Dutch National Flag Problem
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. 
No use of any sorting function that Python provides is allowed.


We implemented the same algorithm in Uacity lesson 2: Sort 0,1,2 to sort the elements in the list

This sorting is accomplished in a single pass and has therefore time complexity O(n).
Since the same number variables are used, independent of the input array, the space complexity is O(1).
