Square Root of an Integer

Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library. 
You have to find the floor value of the square root.
For example if the given number is 16, then the answer would be 4.
If the given number is 27, the answer would be 5 because sqrt(5) = 5.196 whose floor value is 5.
Expected Algorithm Efficiency
The expected time complexity is O(log(n))
The space complexity is O(1).

We made an absolute divided of the number by 2 to get a middle bisection.

We recomputed the square using the mid values  and comapred to the actual integer.
if it matches then, we return the mid value. Else, we recurse the function using the mid value if it is greater or less than the integer. 
To obtai the floor value we used //1.0 to method in python as a division operator.

Just as a binary search has time complexity O(log(n)), so does this bisection method. 
Since the program uses the same small set of variables the space complexity is O(1).
