Rearrange Array Digits
Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two integers such that their sum is a maximum and return these two numbers. 
One can assume that all array elements are in the range [0, 9]. 
The number of digits in both the numbers cannot differ by more than 1. 
One can not use any sorting function that Python provides and the expected time complexity must be O(nlog(n)).

Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

One expected answer would be [531, 42]. Another expected answer can be [542, 31]. In scenarios such as these when there are more than one possible answers, return any one.

We  used a merge sorting algorithm  which has a time complexity of O(nlogn) to sort the elements. 
Then we used python's reversed function to which has an efficiency of O(n) to reverse the list into descending order.
The Rearrange method then uses a greedy approach to build the two lists by alternatively placing elements into the two lists.

This returns a list of two elements with a space complexity of O(n)
